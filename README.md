This is a collection of scripts meant to install desktop environments on unix-like operating systems following a base install.  I call one of these 'complete' when it meets the following requirements:
* A graphical logon manager is presented without user intervention after powering on the machine
* Logging into that graphical logon manager takes the user into the specified desktop environment
* The user can open a terminal emulator

# Usage

```
git clone https://www.github.com/rosedovell/unixdesktops
cd unixdesktop
sh ./install.sh
```
